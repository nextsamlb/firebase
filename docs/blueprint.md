## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Professional blue (#3498DB) to convey trust and reliability.  The app will be related to the management of sensitive information. A serious blue inspires a sense of dependability. I chose this vivid shade for good visual contrast in the layout.
- Background color: Subtle light gray (#F2F4F4) to provide a clean and neutral backdrop. The hue is very close to the primary color but heavily desaturated and lightened for a background role.
- Accent color: Complementary light blue (#7FB7BE) to highlight key actions and interactive elements, clearly standing out from the primary blue and background.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for both headlines and body text, offering a modern and readable aesthetic.
- Use simple, professional icons to enhance usability and visual appeal. Use icons in the chosen blue color, on the neutral background.
- Design a clean and intuitive layout with clear hierarchy to ensure ease of navigation.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback and improve user experience.
